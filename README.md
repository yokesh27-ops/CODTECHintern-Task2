## Overview of the Project

### Project:  TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY MONITORING WITH DHT SENSOR

### Objective
The objective of this task is to design a system that continuously reads temperature and humidity data from a DHT22 sensor and displays it in real-time. 

### Key components
Hardware:
DHT22 Sensor
Arduino Board (or other microcontroller)
Breadboard and Jumper Wires
Optional: LCD/OLED Display, Buzzer, or LEDs for additional functionality.

Software:
Arduino IDE (or other programming environments).
DHT library for Arduino for easier interfacing.

### Learning Goals:
Understand how the DHT sensor works.
Gain hands-on experience interfacing sensors with microcontrollers.
Develop skills in programming for data acquisition and display.

### Outcome
The outcome of this task is a functional temperature and humidity monitoring system using the DHT22 sensor, capable of real-time data display. This enhances your skills in sensor integration and embedded systems development.
